# FSI-Autism-Video

Video can be an essential tool in behavior treatment for autism from very simplistic use cases, like the ability for Behavior Analysis to be able to view more therapist interactions and provide more feedback, but there is great opportunity for modern technologies to transform the autism industry. So, there would be immediate benefit, but also possibility of greater impact by having video data. This was the premise of the original use case when the project was started during the first Microsoft Financial Services Autism Hackathon in 2018.

## 2018 Use Case 
The goal of the 2018 project was to connect data, collected by a system (there are many of them but we used the structure from a specific provider) and overlay it over a video. Also enabled a way for analysts and therapists/technicians to add commentary to a session. The end user could view the session and see the commentary and data associated with specific points in the video.

## 2019 Use Case 
Leverage work done on prior yearâ€™s project and enhance in three potential areas. First, extract text from the video, store, and check for progress over time. Also look for key words. Second, track sentiment of subject and potentially consider additional expressions which might be useful for autism therapy. Third, create montage of key data collection points for BCBA review so they can evaluate more cases sessions and provide better service for more subjects.

## 2020 Use Case
Leverage the Azure Kinect for the video use case to collect video and utilize Kinect's capabilities to demonstrate how it could assist therapists/technicians. It could do this in a few ways, for example, learning from data collection in app, combined with Azure Kinect data to learn possible stereotypies and recommend data collection points. Ideally, it would be an ambient intelligence to help with consistency of data collection, and help the therapist/technician from collecting data so they can spend more time with the subject.

## Next Steps
There are a number of ways this project can go but it would be great to find a way for families to easily stand up a system and start collecting footage/data for some of the more basic services, while retaining the data for analysis.
